# Tutor provides the `tutor MODE do JOB ...` CLI as a consistent way to execute jobs
# across the dev, local, and k8s modes. To support jobs in the docker compose modes
# (dev and local), we must define a `-job` variant service in which jobs could be run.

# When `tutor local do JOB ...` is invoked, we `docker compose run` each of JOB's
# tasks against the appropriate `-job` services, as defined here.
# When `tutor dev do JOB ...` is invoked, we do the same, but also include any
# compose overrides in ../dev/docker-compose.jobs.yml.

# Note that these services will all be `run` rather than `start`ed and `exec`ed.
# This is because jobs are often used for initialization tasks, which may need to
# happen before the service can be successfully `start`ed.
